# Advanced-Programming
The repository contains the files for my Advanced Programming project.

Project description:
This program is intended to create a virtual personal library and keep track of the books read as well as plotting nice graphs with de data regarding read books.

Correct functioning:
For correct program functioning you should keep the three Python scripts in the same folder. The full functionalities are accessed by running the "MainMenu.py" file. The other two scripts will run on their own but the experience won't be full.

Required libraries:
The libraries employed by the program are
- PyQt5
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- requests

You can install them by running the installs.bat
